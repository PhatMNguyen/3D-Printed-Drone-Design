UTA has held the 3D-Printed Aircraft Competition (PAC) for eight years. A rotatory 
drone was 3D printed through additive manufacturing to compete in the 3D-printed aircraft 
competition. The drone was developed in several parts, including electronics, drone frame, arms, 
and drag device. Each component was designed and researched to be lightweight with minimal 
vibration and stiff structure. The electronics were chosen to ensure enough thrusting force and 
power to withstand the weight of the drone and drag device. The 3D filament chosen for the 
drone is abs, which was chosen based on its performance to heat, low density, and high elastic 
modulus, ensuring a stiff structure. Using topology optimization and solid works a 5‚Äù arm was 
created with stiffness and weight as our main objective. The drag device was created as a hinge, 
so the flaps were able to descend slowly, our main goal was to increase surface area without any 
electronic actuation. The design was further improved and tested through simulation and 
experimentation to ensure maximum stiffness, minimum frequencies, fast response and stable 
flight. The progression from the start to the final design took many iterations, but each iteration 
improved the overall design. The final iteration of our design was able to achieve 30 feet in the 8 
second time frame and a free fall time of 3 seconds.
